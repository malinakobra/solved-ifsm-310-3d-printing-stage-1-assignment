Before you begin this assignment, be sure you:

<ul>

 <li>Have completed all previously assigned readings, particularly those assigned in Weeks 1 and 2 of the class.</li>

 <li>Read the “3D Printing Case Study.”</li>

</ul>

The Case Study presents Mark’s 3D printing business and explains how he wants to expand his operation with more IT infrastructure and additional employees.  He has asked you to help him better understand what he currently has and what he will need to create the business he envisions.  You realize that although he already has several hardware and network components in use, he really does not have any idea how to expand into a larger operation.  You decide to begin with what he has, what his requirements are, and what components he will need to meet his requirements.

<strong>Assi</strong>gnment:

Using the Case Study and course materials, your task is to write a paper to Mark that includes the following:

<ol>

 <li><strong>Background</strong> – briefly describe the business to be supported by the new infrastructure.</li>

 <li><strong>Current IT infrastructure</strong> – List the hardware, software, and network components that Mark <u>currently</u> has in place (not what he wants to add with his “Expansion Plan”). Note that you may need to make some assumptions about the components based on what is provided in the Case Study.</li>

 <li><strong>Requirements </strong>– List five requirements Mark has identified that the systems will have to perform or support as he expands his business. These can be “business” needs or part of the 3D printing operation.</li>

 <li><strong>How requirements will be met – </strong>Briefly explain to Mark what system components will be needed to meet each of the five requirements listed above. These may be components he already has or new components to be added.</li>

 <li><strong>Data representation and storage – </strong>Finally, Mark needs to store and use several types of data: digital and numerical, audio, video and graphics data.  Explain to him how each of these types of data are represented in digital form, how they are stored, and on which device(s) (either in place or something he needs to add) each type of data will be stored.  Include each of the following:

  <ol>

   <li>Digital and numerical data</li>

   <li>Audio data</li>

   <li>Video data</li>

   <li>Graphics data</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<strong>References</strong>:

Incorporate <u>at least two</u> resources correctly; one reference should be from the course materials and one reference should be external.  An external resource is a resource other than those provided in the class or textbook.  Incorporate properly formatted APA citations in the text of your document for each reference used.  Then, place an APA style reference page at the end of your document.

<strong>Formatting:  </strong><strong>  </strong>

<strong> </strong>

For academic writing, the writer is expected to write in the third person. In third person, the writer avoids the pronouns I, we, my, and ours. The third person is used to make the writing more objective by taking the individual, the “self,” out of the writing. This method is very helpful for academic writing, a form in which facts, not opinion, drive the tone of the text. Writing in the third person allows the writer to come across as unbiased and thus more informed.




<ul>

 <li>Write a short concise paper, 2-3 single spaced pages in length.</li>

 <li>Use <u>at least</u> two resources with APA formatted citation and reference. Use at least one external reference and one from the course content.</li>

 <li>Compare your work to the Grading Rubric below to be sure you have met content and quality criteria.</li>

 <li>Submit your paper as a Microsoft Word document, or a document that can be read in Word.</li>

 <li>Your submission should include <strong><u>your last name first in the filename</u>: </strong>    <strong>Lastname_firstname_Stage_1</strong></li>

</ul>




<strong>GRADING RUBRIC:</strong>




The “right” and “wrong” answers have to do with whether or not you correctly incorporated the course vocabulary and concepts from the textbook to support your choices and have addressed all parts of the assignment.
